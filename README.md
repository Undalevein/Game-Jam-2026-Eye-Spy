# LMU Game Jam 2026

[Insert Description of the Game Here]

A game was created during the 48-hour LMU 2025-2026 Game Jam competition. The theme for the project is *Eyes*, which was interpreted by the group as "surveillance" and "watching," and during ideation we thought of something horror related.
